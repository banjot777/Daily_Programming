{
	public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception
	{
		// your code goes here
		Scanner sc= new Scanner(System.in);
		int t=sc.nextInt();
		for(int i=0;i<t;i++){
		    int X=sc.nextInt();
		    int Y=sc.nextInt();
		    
		    if(X>=2*Y)
		        System.out.println("Yes");
		    else  
		        System.out.println("No");
